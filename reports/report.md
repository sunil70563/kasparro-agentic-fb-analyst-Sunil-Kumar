# Analysis Report

## Query: Why did ROAS drop and please suggest new ad creatives to fix it.

## Diagnosis
### 1. Diagnosis
The ROAS has dropped from 7.63 to 7.55, indicating a decline in return on ad spend.

### 2. Key Drivers
- The spend has decreased by 1.52%, which could be a contributing factor to the drop in ROAS, as reduced spend can lead to lower sales and revenue.

### 3. Recommendation
Test new ad creatives for the "Men Bold Colors Drop" campaign, focusing on more subtle color schemes or alternative design elements to appeal to a broader audience and potentially improve the campaign's ROAS, thereby lifting the overall return on ad spend.
